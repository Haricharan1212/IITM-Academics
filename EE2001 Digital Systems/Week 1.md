**What are the advantages of digital systems?**
- Resilience to noise -> Noise forms a Gaussian distribution around the actual value. Filtering analog signals is hard, especially with noise.
- Ease of storage -> Flash/CD/DVD
	- Previously stored in analog form in magnetic tapes
- More secure (encrypted)
- Flexible signal processing (e.g. noise removal)

**What are some examples and applications of digital systems?**
- Digital thermometers
- automated driving
- digital computer stuff
- augmented reality, etc.
- The AI

**What is the anatomy of a digital system?**
- Top down methodology: we talk about big things and break it into smaller pieces
- Implement
	- Sequential logic
	- Combinational logic

**Blocks in a Mobile Phone!**

**What is a system on a chip?**
Microprocesser | Microcontroller
--- | ---
It's used in computer systems like desktops, etc. | It's used in embedded systems like washing machine, etc.

**Anatomy of a smartphone- What is the iPhone SOC?**
Huge number of logic blocks
CLB-> configurable logic block
Logic blocks-> consists of logic gates like NOR gates, AND gates, etc. and clocks

**Combinational logic gate that does comparison**

Sequential logic: uses clock cycles and does stuff, and synchronizes stuff
