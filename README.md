Hi

Most of the files are in markdown, and they're in obsidian flavour markdown, so it's better if you clone the repo and use obsidian to view the files (github and notion have issues rendering some of the latex).

The notes are now available in PDF versions as well.

If there are any errors/resources you want to share, feel free to drop me a message!
