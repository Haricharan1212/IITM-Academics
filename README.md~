Hi

Most of the files are in markdown, and they're in obsidian flavour markdown, so it's better if you clone the repo and use obsidian to view the files (github has issues rendering the latex).

I will convert completed notes into PDFs and upload them at one point.

If there are any errors/resources you want to share, feel free to drop me a message!
